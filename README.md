# SAIsim
Sexually Antagonistic Inversion Simulator

## Purpose
This simulator models populations forward-in-time carrying variants that carry survival and male reproductive benefit effects. It models paracentric inversions, and helps investigate how these factors contribute to the maintenance of inversion polymorphisms and the accumulation of sexually antagonistic variation.

## Setup

### Dependencies
- numpy

### Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:csm228/SAIsim.git
```
<!-- 
## Usage
 -->

## Condor Integration
SAIsim was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and includes scripts for running simulations on the Center for High-Throughput Computing (CHTC) HTCondor distributed computing software and network.
